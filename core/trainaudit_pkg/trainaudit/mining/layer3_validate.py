"""Layer 3: validate candidate predicates against multiple healthy traces.

A candidate predicate is **accepted** as a verified invariant only if it
produces *zero* violations across every healthy trace. If it fires on
some, the predicate is either:
  - genuinely too strict — reject as spurious, or
  - missing a precondition — precondition inference tries to
    derive a differentiating attribute (e.g. `zero_stage<3`)

Tolerance auto-learning: for `BOUND` predicates with no fixed threshold,
the validator records the field's percentile distribution across all
healthy events and reports `quantile_pct` so the predicate can be
re-emitted with a learned threshold.
